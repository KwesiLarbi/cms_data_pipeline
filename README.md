## Medicare Monthly Enrollment Data
The Medicare Monthly Enrollment data provides current monthly information on the number of Medicare beneficiaries with hospital/medical coverage and prescription drug coverage, available for several geographic areas including national, state/territory, and county. The hospital/medical coverage data can be broken down further by health care delivery (Original Medicare versus Medicare Advantage and Other Health Plans) and the prescription drug coverage data can be examined by those enrolled in stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans and those enrolled in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans. The dataset provides monthly and yearly enrollee trends.
